# B45 Labs Coding Standard (Revit 2025/2026)

## 1) Purpose and Scope

All add-in code must target Autodesk Revit 2025 and 2026 APIs.
Priority order: correctness > robustness > maintainability > performance > brevity.
The codebase should remain predictable for long-term maintenance and team handoff.
## 2) File Organization and Structure

Every C# file must start with a standard header describing:
Purpose
Key behaviors
Revit API notes (2025/2026 constraints)
Design decisions (trade-offs)
Organize code with clear sections (use #region when it improves navigation):
Construction / Setup
Core Workflow
Revit API Helpers
UI / MVVM
Error Handling / Reporting
Cleanup / Disposal
## 3) Comments and Documentation (English Only)

All comments must be written in English.
Prefer “why” comments over “what” comments.
Add XML docs (/// <summary>) for:
public classes
public methods
critical private helpers (anything non-trivial)
## 4) Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming:
PascalCase for classes, methods, properties
camelCase for local variables and parameters
_camelCase for private fields
Method intent must be explicit:
Try* = best-effort, should not throw, returns success/failure
Ensure* = guarantees a state (e.g., “exists in target”)
Build* / Create* = constructs new instances or objects
## 5) Revit 2025/2026 API Compatibility

Never use ElementId.IntegerValue (removed). Use:
ElementId.Value (long) for numeric keys/IDs
When comparing categories:
Use category.Id.Value == (long)BuiltInCategory.XXX
Avoid obsolete APIs and document exceptions in the file header if unavoidable.
## 6) Transactions and Document Safety

Large workflows must be wrapped in a TransactionGroup.
Keep Transactions small and single-purpose:
“Create Sheet”
“Copy Sheet Elements”
“Place Viewport”
Always commit/rollback explicitly:
Use try { Commit } catch { RollBack } for safety
Never leave a transaction open across UI interactions.
# 7) Error Handling and Best-Effort Behavior

The command should not fail because one item fails.
Use best-effort patterns:
catch exceptions locally, continue processing
record “skipped” counters/reasons when relevant
Avoid silent failures for critical steps:
Provide meaningful final reporting (counts + skipped reasons).
## 8) Performance (Pragmatic)

Use FilteredElementCollector correctly:
restrict by view id when possible
filter by class/category early
Cache expensive lookups when repeated:
view name sets
preview images
type matches
Avoid repeated full-document scans inside loops.
## 9) MVVM and WPF Standards

ViewModels must be UI-agnostic:
no references to Window/UI elements
no direct dispatcher logic unless strictly needed
Use:
INotifyPropertyChanged
ObservableCollection<T>
Bindings should target stable VM properties:
SelectedSheet, PreviewImage, SummaryText, etc.
Prefer DataTrigger over converters when possible (especially for visibility/placeholder).
## 10) Reporting and User Feedback

Always show a final operation report (e.g., InfoDialog) containing:
Created counts
Copied counts
Placed counts
Skipped counts (with reason)
Reports must be consistent, short, and actionable.
## 11) Code Quality Baselines

No dead code, no commented-out blocks in production branches.
Helpers must be reusable and single-responsibility.
Favor readable code with explicit variable names over micro-optimizations.
## 12) Required Output Style for ChatGPT-Assisted Code

When generating or revising code in this repository:

Follow this standard exactly.
Use maximum helpful commentary (English).
Ensure Revit 2025/2026 compatibility by default.
Provide drop-in replacement files whenever possible.
